I need a class which provides the following information:
1)
A list of atoms by atomic number

2)
A list of connections for each atom

3)
A list of the relative strengths for each atom?

I want the following interface:

int getSize();//returns the number of atoms

float getAtoms(int atom);//returns the atomic number of the specified atom where atoms are in a range from 0-getSize() and ordered from the highest atomic number to the lowest atomic number.

int getLinks(int atom);//returns the number of bonds the speciified atom forms

int getLink(int atom, int link);//returns the index of the atom to which the specified bond is formed

int getLinkMult(int atom, int link);//returns the multiplicity of the specified bond (ie: 1 for single bond, 2 for double bond, etc)

I'll work on printing the diagram based on this interface.
